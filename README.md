# Stephen_Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio where I showcase what I have learned since I started on my journey programming and delving
into data science. 

It has been an interesting journey with a lot of turns, hesitations and returns, but I am getting there and
building myself one day at a time.

This website is still a lot of work away from being perfect, but one has to start somewhere. Right?
